# British Airways Data Science Virtual Experience Programme
This repository contains the code and resources for the British Airways Data Science virtual internship programme. The programme consists of two tasks focused on customer review analysis and customer buying behavior prediction.

# Task 1: Customer Review Analysis
In this task, we will perform customer review analysis by following these steps:
1. Web scrape customer reviews from the Airline Quality website.
2. Apply sentiment analysis techniques to classify reviews as positive or negative.
3. Analyze the sentiment trends over time to understand any changes in customer perceptions.
4. Extract co-occurring word pairs from negative reviews to identify the most relevant words in context.
5. Prepare a PowerPoint presentation to showcase the insights and analysis derived from the review data.

# Task 2: Customer Buying Behavior Prediction
For this task, we aim to build a predictive model to understand factors that influence customer buying behavior. The main steps involved are:
1. Delete high cardinality variables from the customer booking dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset by encoding categorical and numerical variables.
3. Train the classification model using suitable machine learning algorithms.
4. Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. Plot the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to visualize model performance.
6. Analyze feature importance to understand which variables contribute most to the predictive model.
7. Create a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the insights and analysis derived from the predictive model.
